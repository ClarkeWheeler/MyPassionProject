		<p>HI! My name is Clarke & I'm a junior at Barnard College studying Political Science, Africana Studies, and Sociology. While I'm originally from Washington, D.C., I love living in New York City and plan to stay here for a few years after graduation. For now, I'm enjoying everything the city and my school has to offer and desperately trying to plan for the future, no matter how useless that may be. </p>

				<p>I've recently been accepted to the CIEE Salvador da Bahia Liberal Arts Program for Spring 2015, meaning I will be studying abroad in Brazil in a few months! Obviously, I'm super excited and will use this space to share my experience in the program. ...</p><br/><br/>
